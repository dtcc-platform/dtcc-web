  "body": "The purpose of this project is to investigate how a virtual copy of the construction site can be used to analyze, visualize, and communicate the progress of construction production in interactive AR/VR environments. By developing and demonstrating prototypes in case studies that combine data from 360-degree camera recordings, 3D scans, openBIM, and 4D BIM models together with AI technology, the project aims to explore new opportunities to support decision-making and streamline the construction process. The goal is to contribute knowledge on how integrated and visually accessible information can create a more data-informed, proactive, and coordinated construction production.",
