  "body": "Building on successful tools and workflows, developed in the Twin ReFab pilot project at the Digital Twin Cities Centre funded by Sweden’s innovation Agency Vinnova, this project will establish digital twins as robust sources of data for resource-efficient, high-quality reuse of reclaimed building materials. The main deliverables include digital tools and workflows supporting reuse in three stages: material harvesting, redesign for reuse, and on-site realization. By providing robust digital support for reuse and utilizing materials from large waste streams in the built environment, the project contributes to the global effort to reduce the environmental impact of architecture and construction and promote circular material flows.",
