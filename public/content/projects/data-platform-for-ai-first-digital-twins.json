  "body": "Data Platform for AI-First Digital Twins is a DTCC milestone project investigating how make urban digital twins and urban digital twin data ready for effective use with AI and machine learning. Traditional digital twin development has often taken a geometry first approach, prioritizing accurate 3D representations optimized for visualization and physical simulation. In contrast, AI-driven applications require data to be structured around semantics, relationships, and patterns that support learning and inference. This project explores how digital twin architectures and data models can be rethought to fully use the potential AI offers and evaluates methods for integrating machine learning into urban digital twin ecosystems.\n\nThe project examines what an AI-first approach to digital twins means in practice, in terms of data models, system design, and workflows. By identifying the technical and methodological gaps between traditional digital twin architectures and AI-driven requirements, the project aims to define the principles, tools, and frameworks needed to make digital twins interoperable with modern AI systems.\n\nKey research directions include:\n•\tAgentic AI — exploring how autonomous agents can build, maintain, and update urban digital twins, and what requirements digital twin platforms and data sources must meet to support such interaction.\n•\tGraph-based data structures —Graph models form the semantic backbone of many digital twins. How AI can automate graph construction from existing data, and how graph-based learning can enhance reasoning and prediction.\n•\tAI-enhanced simulation — combining traditional simulation models with machine learning to create hybrid approaches that are faster, more adaptive, and more insightful for urban planning and decision support.",
