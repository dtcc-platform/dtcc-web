  "body": "Urban planning and decision-making increasingly rely on physics-based analysis and immersive visualization, yet the scarcity of reliable, high-fidelity 3D city models remains a critical challenge. Current geospatial data—spanning LiDAR, aerial orthophotos, street-level imagery, and cadastral maps—are rich but fragmented, and manually creating simulation-ready models is time-intensive and expensive. AI offers a transformative solution, enabling automated fusion of these diverse data sources to generate detailed, scalable 3D city models.\n\nThe AI 3D City Generation project at Chalmers’ Digital Twin Cities Centre (DTCC) pioneers advanced machine-learning and mathematical methods to produce high-fidelity, topology-consistent 3D models from raw data. These models feature watertight surfaces, robust connectivity, and quantifiable accuracy. Released as open-source components within the DTCC Platform, our results are validated using real-world data from partner cities and municipalities. The resulting city models empower a wide range of applications, including pedestrian wind comfort analysis, urban heat and solar studies, flood and noise modeling, infrastructure planning, and immersive AR/VR visualizations.",
