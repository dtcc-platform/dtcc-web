          The Digital Twin Cities Centre (DTCC) is a national research centre at Chalmers University of Technology. Since 2020, we've worked with municipalities, industry leaders, and international universities to explore how digital twins can make city planning and construction smarter and more sustainable. Our vision is to establish Sweden as a world leader in digital twin cities by 2030.
