          Cities become digital twins of themselves. They mirror how a place functions — from infrastructure to mobility — then allow us to test and explore scenarios, understanding how choices ripple in the real world. A digital twin isn't a copy; it's a learning environment, built on data and scientific models.
        </p>
        <p class="brodtext-20 muted">
          The bigger picture? Digital twins help organisations plan for the future, reduce risk and improve outcomes for people. They make it easier to collaborate across disciplines and with citizens, breaking down silos and helping ideas travel further and faster.
